### Problem: 
There is currently no social application for users to find other users that are looking to exchange their skill time for others. If someon neeeds something to get done such as dog walking, they cannot offeer another person their time in exchange. Currently, all skills transactions are based on monetary currency.

### General App Idea/Purpose: 
An app that allows users to securely view other skilld workers and reviews in order to select a person thy would like to trade their time with. For instance, if a user needs a dog walkeer, they can find one on the application and exchane their time for the other user's. 

### Who Would Use It: 
People in the United States with exchangeable skills such as plumbing or transporting. Users who do not want to have to spend money on jobs from other people and would ratheer exchange their time.
